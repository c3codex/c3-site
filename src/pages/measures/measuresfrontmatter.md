 Measures of Inanna  
 An Exhibition in Three Movements

Measures of Inanna is the work.  
Descent, Epithets, and Mandala Expressions are its measures.

Each measure is distinct in purpose.  
Each applies a different form of pressure.  
Each reveals coherence in its own way.

Inanna is present within each measure as *Measure* itself.

She does not depend on recognition.  
She does not require interpretation.  
She is not altered by passage.

Inanna Descends

7 Obsidian Gates, the measure is descent.

What cannot remain coherent is released.

The gates that follow enact this measure through original artwork, motion,  
and fragments drawn from early Sumerian source material.

Nothing here asks to be understood.  
Nothing here seeks agreement.

The measure holds  
with or without witness.
