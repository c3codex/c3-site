# Obsidian Audio Protocol
### Measures of Inanna — Operational Audio Layer

## Purpose
The Obsidian Audio Protocol defines how continuous sound is used as a **structural condition** within the Obsidian descent sequence.

This audio layer is not music.
It is not narrative.
It is not decorative.

It functions as **pressure**, continuity, and physiological grounding across transitions.

---

## Core Principle
If sound is loud enough to be noticed as content, it competes with the work.

If sound is quiet enough to be *missed when absent*, it becomes container.

The Obsidian Bed is designed to be:
- Barely audible
- Felt more than heard
- Continuous across state changes

---

## Audio Architecture

### Track Structure
- **Track A — Tonal Center**
  - Fixed frequency (Key of E)
  - Acts as the structural spine
  - Does not modulate

- **Track B — φ Companion**
  - Very slow modulation (amplitude or phase)
  - Based on φ ratios
  - Introduces organic motion without melody

Together, these form a standing field rather than a song.

---

## Where the Obsidian Bed Is Active

### ON (Active)
The Obsidian Bed **must be active continuously** across the full descent:

- Obsidian Epigraph Intro
- Kumurrah transition
- Obsidian Gate Index
- Obsidian Gate Plates (Gate 0 → Gate 7)

There should be **no audible start/stop between these views**.

---

### OFF (Inactive)
The Obsidian Bed is **not active** in:

- Measures TempleHome
- Exhibition / Antechamber
- Non-Obsidian pillars (Crystal, Marble, Priceless Gallery)

Silence here is intentional and marks threshold.

---

## Interaction With Text (Plaques)

### Ducking Rule
When a plaque opens:
- Obsidian Bed volume is **ducked** (lowered)
- The tone does not stop
- The field contracts inward

When a plaque closes or minimizes:
- Obsidian Bed volume is **restored**
- The field expands back into the room

This creates the felt sense that:
- Reading is an inward act
- Viewing is an outward act

---

## Psychological / Physiological Rationale

1. **Continuity Across Motion**
   Video → still → pause → text can feel like separate events.
   A constant bed tone binds them into a single descent gesture.

2. **Soft Entrainment**
   A stable, low-level tone provides a reference point for the nervous system.
   The body registers steadiness even when the ear does not register sound.

3. **Meaningful Silence**
   When a tone is always present, its absence becomes perceptible.
   Silence becomes architectural, not empty.

---

## Volume Guidelines (Reference Values)

These are starting points and may be tuned:

- **Active (viewing):** ~0.20–0.25
- **Ducked (reading):** ~0.06–0.10
- **Inactive:** muted / paused

The correct level is reached when:
- Headphones reveal the tone clearly
- Laptop speakers barely reveal it
- The user notices something missing when it stops

---

## Design Constraint
The Obsidian Bed must **never resolve**.

No chord changes.
No melodic arcs.
No rhythmic pulses.

It is pressure held steady.

---

## Conceptual Alignment
Obsidian represents subtraction, descent, and removal.

The audio behaves the same way:
- It does not perform
- It does not explain
- It does not resolve

It remains present while everything else is stripped away.

---

## Implementation Notes
- Audio is managed centrally via a Measures Audio Bus
- Individual components only signal state changes (active, duck, restore)
- Audio files live in `/public/audio/`
- Format: WAV or high-quality MP3
- Sample rate: 44.1 kHz or 48 kHz (consistent across tracks)

---

## Closing
This protocol treats sound as material, not ornament.

The Obsidian Bed does not accompany the descent.
It **is part of the descent**.
